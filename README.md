# Tlingit Language and Culture Project
Visualizing familial connections and regional onomastics of the Tlingit people.

## About
This project was created for my Human Ecology class, taken during the summer of 2019 at The Harker School.

As part of the course, we spend 12 days in Alaska, exploring Sitka, Juneau, and the Inian Islands. The Tlingit are a group of indigenous peoples living on the Northwest coast of North America. They have an incredibly structured social system, supported by the abundance of marine life in the neighboring Pacific Ocean.

The Tlingit language is from the Na-Dene language family and has a highly complex phonology, in comparison to modern Indo-European languages. Unfortunately, it is also highly endangered, with only 500 fluent speakers in Alaska in 2007.

My project explores this rich language, investigating the social dynamics that lead parents to chose certain names for their children. My project also studies how identity is defined in American Indian groups and how familial traditions are preserved and passed on.
