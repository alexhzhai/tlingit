        <p class="info-paragraph">She had many <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord6();">Tlingit</a> names, and <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord1();">Stan Tlaa</a> was just one of them.</p>

        <p class="info-paragraph"><a class="special-underline default">Janet Lee Ketchum Steinbright</a> was born in 1941 in Juneau, AK.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Her native name is <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord1();">Stan Tlaa</a>, which translates to <a class="special-underline default">“outside mother.”</a> Jan jokingly wonders if this name means someone who likes to be outdoors (which she says is true) or if it means someone who is out of the clan.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">In 1983, she was adopted by a <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord6();">Tlingit</a> clan. Tlingit clans will usually adopt people who work for and help them. Jan had been giving workshops (on basketry and weaving) in Haines, and the tribe took notice.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Jan was adopted by two <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord5();">yanwáat</a> (elders) of the clan, Cecilia Kunz (<a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord1();">Stan Tlaa</a>) and Lillian Hammond.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">From her adoption, Jan was given these crests: she is from the <a class="special-underline default">Raven moiety</a>, the <a class="special-underline default">Coho clan</a>, and her house is the <a class="special-underline default">Diginaa Hit</a> (the frog).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">In 1995, Jan married a Tlingit man, <a class="special-underline default">Paul Manson Jackson.</a></p>

      <div class="fourth addtlInfo" id="marriageInfo">
        <p class="info-paragraph">When Jan and Paul married each other, both were part of the Raven moiety. In Tlingit culture, marriages are normally between people of opposite moities (ravens with eagles and eagles with ravens).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Their marriage confused some of their peers and sometimes brought unwarranted judgement at social gatherings like <a class="special-underline default">potlatches</a> (traditional ceremonial feasts).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Jan recounts that, when they decided to get married, Paul asked if she would get redopted and become eagle. Jan said she was adopted raven long before she knew him and felt a <a class="special-underline default">strong connection with keeping her Raven identity.</a></p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">Nowadays, people are marrying more in the same moiety, and the rule of marriage between raven and eagle is less strict. Jan attributes this to it now being <a class="special-underline default">“contemporary times.”</a></p>

        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">His native name is <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord3();">Skeenya</a>, because he reminded his clan of a particularly tall, skinny basketball player.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="info-paragraph">In the Steinbright family, the men take the first initial of their first name and <a class="special-underline default">go by their middle name</a> which is a family name in my family from Scotland.
