      <p class="info-paragraph"><a class="special-underline default">Luis Charles "Chuck" Miller</a> is a Tlingit Cultural Educator in Sitka, AK. His English name was chosen by his mother in memory of a non-biological family member named Luis.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="info-paragraph">His <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord6();">Tlingit</a> name is <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord16();">Daanax.ils’eik</a>, which was chosen by a family member who had died in 1972 and had asked Chuck's mother to name her next son after him. Chuck was born in 1973.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="info-paragraph">Chuck is from the <a class="special-underline default">Raven moiety</a> and the <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord9();">L'uknax.adi</a> (Silver Salmon) clan. The clan chose the silver salmon as their emblem becuase one of their women was disrespectful to the Silver Salmon while harvesting the fish and ended up being taken away by them. <a class="special-underline default">She eventually became one of them.</a></p>

      <br>
      <p class="info-paragraph">He has two Tlingit names. The first is <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord17();">Keich’Eesh</a>, which was a gift from his great grandmother at his birth, after his great grand uncle on his mother's side.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="info-paragraph">His second Tlingit name is <a class="audio" href="javascript:playWord18();">Yaanjindul.hein</a>, which was a gift from his great grandfather's clan (a different wolf housegroup). It was his grandfather's birth name.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="info-paragraph">Chuck had no say in the naming because <a class="special-underline default">his son's name had to be from his family from the Wolf moiety.</a></p>
